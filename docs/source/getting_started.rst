**Galaxy Modules for Compound Activity Classification (GCAC)**


GCAC is a Galaxy Module for “Virtual Screening of Candidate Drug Molecules using Machine Learning Approach”. 
 
The GCAC module is primarily divided into three major sections viz. 

|  i) Descriptor calculation 
|  ii) Model Building and Prediction 
|  iii) Candidate Molecules Extraction 
|

These sections are implemented as Galaxy tools/utilities along with 
associated helper Galaxy tools such as input preparation, format conversion, etc. 
The list of these Galaxy tools/utilities are provided in :ref:`list_gcac_tools`.
